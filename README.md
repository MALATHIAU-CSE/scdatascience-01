# SkillCraft Technology Data Science Projects

## Overview

This repository contains solutions and analysis for a series of four data science tasks. Each task focuses on a different aspect of the data science lifecycle, from data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to machine learning model building and practical data analysis.

The goal of these projects is to demonstrate proficiency in various data science techniques, including:
* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data Visualization
* Machine Learning Classification
* Analyzing Patterns and Trends

## Project Tasks

### Task 1: Data Visualization

* **Objective**: Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.
* **Description**: The task involves using a sample population dataset to create a visualization (e.g., a histogram for age distribution or a bar chart for gender distribution). The goal is to effectively represent the spread and frequency of a key variable.
* **Dataset**: A sample dataset (to be specified or created).

### Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* **Objective**: Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset.
* **Description**: This task involves loading the provided dataset, handling missing values, identifying outliers, and exploring the relationships between different variables (e.g., survival rate vs. passenger class, age, or gender) to identify patterns and trends.
* **Dataset**: [Titanic Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

### Task 3: Machine Learning Classification

* **Objective**: Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service.
* **Description**: Using the Bank Marketing dataset, a machine learning model will be trained to predict customer behavior based on demographic and behavioral data. The project involves preparing the data, training a decision tree model, and evaluating its performance.
* **Dataset**: [Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing)

### Task 4: Traffic Accident Analysis

* **Objective**: Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns and visualize accident hotspots.
* **Description**: This task focuses on analyzing a traffic accident dataset to find patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. The key outcome is a visualization of accident hotspots and an analysis of the contributing factors to these accidents.
* **Dataset**: [Accident Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanketverma/road-traffic-accidents-dataset)

## Project Structure

It is recommended to organize your project files in a clear structure
## Technologies Used

* **Python**: The primary programming language.
* **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For creating data visualizations.
* **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model building (Task 3).
* **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and documentation.
